# Build an A-Team

The major themes in Whitney Johnson's book "[Building an A-Team](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Team-Their-Strengths-Learning/dp/1633693643?tag=wwwroth-20)" revolve around dynamic team management and employee development. Key themes include:

1.  **Disrupting Your Team**: To build a competitive and innovative team, it's essential to disrupt your people, encouraging them to learn and master new things, thereby keeping them engaged and innovative​​.
    
2.  **The S Curve of Learning**: This concept suggests that employees at different stages of learning (beginning, middle, and mastery) require different management approaches. The middle of the curve, where rapid learning and high engagement occur, is crucial for maintaining a productive team​​.
    
3.  **Hiring for Potential, Not Just Proficiency**: The book advocates for hiring individuals with expansive potential rather than just those who are currently most qualified, thereby extending the period of high engagement and innovation​​.
    
4.  **The Necessity of Friction**: Innovation requires a degree of friction and challenge. When employees master their jobs, they may become bored and complacent, stifling innovation​​.
    
5.  **Crouch Before You Jump**: This metaphor suggests the importance of making strategic moves (sometimes even backwards or sideways) to gain new skills and perspectives, vital for innovation and avoiding stagnation​​.
    
These themes collectively highlight the importance of dynamic, adaptive leadership in building and maintaining an effective, innovative team.

### Disrupting Your Team
 
The concept of "Disrupting Your Team" emphasizes the importance of challenging and engaging team members to foster innovation and competitiveness. This disruption is not about creating chaos but about encouraging continuous learning and development. The idea is that humans, inherently inclined to learn, are most engaged and productive when they are acquiring new skills and facing new challenges. When team members master their roles, they should be encouraged to start anew, with fresh challenges and learning opportunities. This approach keeps the team dynamic, prevents stagnation, and promotes a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

### **The S Curve of Learning**
The S Curve of Learning is a framework that applies the principles of innovation curves to personal development. It consists of three stages: the initial phase where individuals face the discomfort and excitement of learning something new, the middle phase characterized by rapid learning and high engagement, and the final phase of mastery, which can lead to boredom if not accompanied by new challenges. The model suggests that an ideal team should have a balanced distribution across these stages, with most employees (about 70%) in the highly productive middle phase, ensuring ongoing development and innovation.

### Hiring for Potential, Not Just Proficiency
"Hiring for Potential, Not Just Proficiency" is a theme emphasizes the value of considering a candidate's future growth potential in addition to their current skill set. This approach suggests that hiring the most qualified candidate in terms of existing skills might shorten the period of high engagement and rapid learning. Instead, by writing more open-ended job ads and looking for candidates who are eager to learn and prove themselves, organizations can tap into a more diverse talent pool and foster a culture of growth and innovation. This method also ensures that employees do not become overqualified too quickly, which can lead to reduced engagement and a lack of challenge in their roles. The emphasis is on finding individuals who can grow with the company and contribute to its evolving needs.

### The Necessity of Friction
  
The concept of "The Necessity of Friction" highlights the importance of challenges and obstacles in fostering innovation and growth within a team. Johnson argues that when employees master their jobs, there's a risk they become bored and complacent, which can hinder innovation. Therefore, introducing friction—in the form of new challenges, stretch assignments, or different roles—helps keep team members engaged and motivated. This friction is essential for preventing stagnation and ensuring that the team continually evolves and adapts, which is crucial for staying competitive and innovative in a rapidly changing business environment.

### Crouch Before You Jump
"Crouch Before You Jump" is a metaphor for the strategic necessity of sometimes taking a step back or sideways in order to make significant progress forward. This concept suggests that it may be beneficial to move into different roles or take on different challenges, even if they seem like a step back, as these experiences can provide new skills and perspectives. This approach can position individuals and teams to effectively tackle new opportunities and challenges, much like crouching before a leap increases the power and reach of the jump. The idea is to make it more compelling to embrace change than to resist it, acknowledging that staying stagnant can be riskier than adapting or moving in unexpected directions.
