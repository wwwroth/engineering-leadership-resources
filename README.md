# Engineering Leadership Resources
This repository is a compilation of notes and book outlines related to engineering leadership.

## Books

After reading a book, my process is to take the notes I've taken along the way and use a LLM to compile a summary of the book to reference at a later date. Here are my open source notes and outlines of books I've found helpful in my path of engineering leadership.

* [The Art of Being Indispensable at Work](./books/the-art-of-being-indispensable-at-work.md) by Bruce Tulgan offers insights and strategies for becoming an indispensable employee in the modern workplace. 
* [Building an A-Team](./books/building-an-a-team.md) by Whitney Johnson revolves around dynamic team management and employee development.
* [The Manager's Path](./books/the-managers-path.md) by Chamille Fournier is a guide for tech leaders, covering everything from mentoring to executive management roles.
* [The Making of a Manager](./books/the-making-of-a-manager.md) by Julie Zhuo is a must-read book for aspiring and current managers, offering a concise and insightful roadmap to navigate the challenges and responsibilities of leadership.
* [Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action](./books/start-with-why.md) by Simon Sinek explores the concept that successful leaders and organizations are those who can identify and communicate their core purpose, or 'Why', to inspire and motivate others.
