# Engineering Leadership Notes
This repository is a compilation of notes and book outlines related to engineering leadership.

## Books

After reading a book, my process is to take the notes I've taken along the way and use a LLM to compile a summary of the book to reference at a later date. Here are my open source notes and outlines of books I've found helpful in my path of engineering leadership.

* [The Art of Being Indispensable at Work](https://github.com/wwwroth/leadership-learning-notes/blob/main/books/the-art-of-being-indispensable-at-work.md) by Bruce Tulgan offers insights and strategies for becoming an indispensable employee in the modern workplace. 
* [Building an A-Team](https://github.com/wwwroth/leadership-learning-notes/blob/main/books/building-an-a-team.md) by Whitney Johnson revolves around dynamic team management and employee development.
* [The Manager's Path](https://github.com/wwwroth/leadership-learning-notes/blob/main/books/the-managers-path.md) by Chamille Fournier is a guide for tech leaders, covering everything from mentoring to executive management roles.
